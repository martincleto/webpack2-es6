## Notes for developers

### Profiling and analysing the bundle

In order to improve and lint your bundle, you might want to inspect and analyse it. A `bundle-stats` npm script is available for this purpose.

* Create a new folder *stats* into your project root folder: `$ mkdir stats`
* `$ npm run bundle-stats`: a *webpack-bundle-stats.json* file will be created into stats/ folder
* Browse <https://webpack.github.io/analyse/> and upload the JSON file. A comprehensive profiling UI will be loaded based on you bundle stats.

Edit *package.json* to change path and JSON file name at your convenience.
